The communities that grow around certain topics and technologies are one of the best perks of being a software developer.   
Be it through blog posts, podcasts, meetups or conferences, content is surely available. One of my favourite ways of sharing one's thoughts and experiences is through talks/meetups, not only you get to learn, but also have the opportunity to talk directly with the people that went through those same things that you might be tackling.  
Yet, one of my biggest cruxes was that I never really thought I had anything interesting enough to share/add to what was already out there, but I knew I wanted to give back to my community and I also wanted to work on my public-speaking skills. So pushing the discouraging thoughts aside I started talking about what I was doing, first informally during lunch to a couple of colleagues, then eventually internally to the whole engineering team at my companies and finally, publicly at tech conferences/meetups. 

Although I don't do it as much as I want to, I've grown fond of talking about the topics I'm passionate about. The biggest takeaways though are these: that there's always someone who appreciates your effort and you will learn/improve from having done so.
